Write a function who takes two unsigned int as parameters and returns the
computed LCM of those parameters.

LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) of two non-zero integers is the smallest postive
integer divisible by the both integers.

A LCM can be calculated in two ways:

- You can calculate every multiples of each integers until you have a common
multiple other than 0

- You can use the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of these two integers and
calculate as follows:

	LCM(x, y) = | x * y | / HCF(x, y)

  | x * y | means "Absolute value of the product of x by y"

If at least one integer is null, LCM is equal to 0.

Your function must be prototyped as follows:

  unsigned int    lcm(unsigned int a, unsigned int b);
*/

#include <stdio.h>

unsigned int	lcm(unsigned int a, unsigned int b)
{
	unsigned int	i;

	if (a == 0 || b == 0)
		return (0);
	if (a > b)
		i = a;
	else
		i = b;
	while (1)
	{
		if (i % a == 0 && i % b == 0)
			return (i);
		i++;
	}
	return (0);
}

/*
int	main(void)
{
	printf("%u\n", lcm(24, 48));
	return (0);
}
